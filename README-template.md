I learn't the use of svg images. based on my previous codes, i mostly use <img> tags to use my images but using <https://github.com/dxmaryood> and <https://github.com/NikosNtaiko> codes as references and was able to make use of such.
As to my css, I learn't the use of 'vh' instead of just '%' and 'px', a feedback given to me by <https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/hitmorecode> and also the use of the <main> tag. Looking at my past codes, I have been using a <div> called 'container' alot. By research, I was able to produce this.


### Continued development
I want to master the use of <svg> tags and their attributes, when to use the <main> tag and when it's advisable to use. I also want to learn other methods of coding responsive website instead of the regular way I do it.

### Useful resources

-(https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/use-svg-images-in-css-html/#:~:text=SVG%20images%20can%20be%20written,element%20in%20your%20HTML%20document.&text=body%3E-,If%20you%20did%20everything%20correctly%2C%20your%20webpage%20should,exactly%20like%20the%20demo%20below.) - This helped me  to understand <svg> images for a moment and how to use them. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- (https://webflow.com/blog/how-and-why-to-use-vh-and-vw-in-webflow#:~:text=To%20use%20vh%20and%20vw,set%20a%20height%20of%2050vh.) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand the use and difference of <vh> and <vw> . I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
